## Warning
- Back-up your files if your not familiar with dotfile setups, the installation will do that for you.
- It only works on Unix based operating systems, if you want to use it on windows use Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL).
- I do not deliver any type of support for these files, so if something breaks it's your own problem.

## Install
1. git clone the repository to your user directory
   ```https://github.com/svliantiss/dotfiles.git```
2. cd into dotfiles
   ```cd dotfiles```
3. Install the dotfiles
   ```./install```
4. Follow the intructions and your done!

## Editing
- I recommend making a Unix based VM and use snapshots to test and edit your own builds.
- All the files are easy to follow and edit, if you use the method I recommended there shouldn't be any problems.

## Issues
- For some reason after installing the extensions via :PlugInstall & Host+I. Git seems to want to add everything into a
  .gitmodules file giving the fatal path is not known for this submodule error, this can be safely ignored if you want
  the error to go away you can use ```git rm -r --cache . -f``` to remove the message.
- Icons might not be working, this is a known issue with devicons, make sure you have NERD font installed (I recommend
  Droid Sans Mono NF), I will update the repository with a fix if there is one.
