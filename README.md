## Warning
- Back-up your files if your not familiar with dotfile setups, the installation will do that for you.
- IT DOES NOT WORK ON WINDOWS (ONLY WSL)
- I do not deliver any type of support for these files, so if something breaks it's your own problem.

## Install
1. git clone the repository to your user directory
   ```https://github.com/svliantiss/dotfiles.git```
2. cd into dotfiles
   ```cd dotfiles```
3. Install the dotfiles
   ```./install```
4. Follow the intructions and your done!

## Editing
- I recommend making a Unix based VM and use snapshots to test and edit your own builds.
- All the files are easy to follow and edit, if you use the method I recommended there shouldn't be any problems.
